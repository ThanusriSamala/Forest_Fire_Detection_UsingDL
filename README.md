# Forest_Fire_Detection_UsingDL  


Forest fires pose a serious threat to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human settlements. The increasing frequency and intensity of these fires, driven by climate change and human activities, highlight the urgent need for efficient and accurate detection systems. Traditional methods of forest fire detection—such as satellite monitoring, sensor networks, and human surveillance—often suffer from delays, limited coverage, and high operational costs.

In recent years, the advancement of deep learning has opened new opportunities in the field of image-based detection systems. Among these, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be particularly effective for visual recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images. In this project, a CNN-based model is employed to detect forest fires from image data, aiming to improve early warning systems and facilitate faster response times.

The proposed model leverages the powerful feature extraction capabilities of CNNs to accurately classify images as fire or non-fire, enabling real-time detection in surveillance footage or aerial imagery. By training the CNN on a carefully curated dataset of forest fire and non-fire images, the system can generalize well to new, unseen data, making it a valuable tool for forest fire monitoring and prevention.
